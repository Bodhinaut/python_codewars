### Expressions matter

* Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ().

* Notes
The numbers are always positive.
The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
You can use the same operation more than once.
_It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
Repetition in numbers may occur .
You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

## sum_of_positive

* You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: array may be empty, in this case return 0.


### oddOrEven

* take in integer array, sum its components, return if the sum is odd or 
even with 'odd' or 'even'


### Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light update_light
* You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.


### sort and star; sort.py
* You will be given an vector of string(s). You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive!!) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.


### grasshopper_sum
* write a program that finds the summation of every number between 1 and 
num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

### combat.py
* returns health after damage

### reverse_seq
* return reverse sequence with input n

### reverse a number reverse_number
* Given a number, write a function to output its reverse digits. (e.g. given 123 the answer is 321)

Numbers should preserve their sign; i.e. a negative number should still be negative when reversed.

Examples
 123 ->  321
-456 -> -654
1000 ->    1


### evaporator
* This program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas.

We know the content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas lost every day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage beyond which the evaporator is no longer useful. All numbers are strictly positive.

The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the evaporator will be out of use.

Note : Content is in fact not necessary in the body of the function "evaporator", you can use it or not use it, as you wish. Some people might prefer to reason with content, some other with percentages only. It's up to you but you must keep it as a parameter because the tests have it as an argument.


### array_mean
* It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script.

Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

The array will never be empty.


### max_tri_sum
* Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .

Notes :
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , ngatives also zeros .

Repeatition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).

Input >> Output Examples
1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {6,8,3} in order , their sum is (17)

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {8, 6, 4} in order , their sum is (18) ,
Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .
3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {12 , 29 , 0} in order , their sum is (41) ,
Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .
