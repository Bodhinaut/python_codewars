### Expressions matter

* Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ().

* Notes
The numbers are always positive.
The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
You can use the same operation more than once.
_It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
Repetition in numbers may occur .
You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

## sum_of_positive

* You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: array may be empty, in this case return 0.


### oddOrEven

* take in integer array, sum its components, return if the sum is odd or 
even with 'odd' or 'even'


### Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light update_light
* You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.


### sort and star; sort.py
* You will be given an vector of string(s). You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive!!) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "***" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.


### grasshopper_sum
* write a program that finds the summation of every number between 1 and 
num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

### combat.py
* returns health after damage

### reverse_seq
* return reverse sequence with input n

### reverse a number reverse_number
* Given a number, write a function to output its reverse digits. (e.g. given 123 the answer is 321)

Numbers should preserve their sign; i.e. a negative number should still be negative when reversed.

Examples
 123 ->  321
-456 -> -654
1000 ->    1
