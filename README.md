### Expressions matter

* Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ().

* Notes
The numbers are always positive.
The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
You can use the same operation more than once.
_It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
Repetition in numbers may occur .
You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

## sum_of_positive

* You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: array may be empty, in this case return 0.
